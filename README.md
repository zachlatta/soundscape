# Soundscape

Ever watch a video like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMAPTo7RVCo)? Or how about like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMAPTo7RVCo)?

I love listening to music when doing work, but I often don't want an experience as "intense" as wearing headphones and hearing just the song I'm listening to pumped straight into my ear, so I turn to videos like the above where I can hear rain or coffee shop sounds in the background, in addition to the music.

Soundscape is a web interface to make your own "soundscapes" from YouTube videos. Open up the editor, paste in some links to YouTube videos with audio you want to use, and then drag them around on the screen to spatially position the audio in your soundscape. Finally, click the share button to get a unique link to your current creation that you can link to friends.

_Soundscape is still in development, and not fully functional yet._
